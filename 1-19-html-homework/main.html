    <h1>Stage Manager Program</h1>
    <p>
      In addition to my homework with Mammmoth, I am also forcing myself to
      learn JS by stumbling through an attempt at<br />
      building a program from scratch. The dream product is massively ambitious,
      and in reality I am more using it as a<br />
      way to grind through the errors and problems associated with early
      learning, but the ultimate goal of the program<br />
      is something that will be usable by Stage Managers in theatre to handle
      almost any typical task imaginable, such as:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customizable Script Layouts</li>
      <li>Line Note Distribution System</li>
      <li>Interactive Blocking Notes</li>
      <li>Portal Designed for Multi-User Collaboration</li>
      <li>Report Generator</li>
      <li>Project Management Infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here is a picture of my son, <b>Orion</b> giving his approval of my work
      on stage (and hopefully offstage as well):

    <p>
      Since I have probably lost the attention of anyone regarding the program I
      was describing due to the overwhelming<br />
      cuteness that is Orion, I might as well just talk about him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orion is 18 months old, and his favorite things include (in descending
      order):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        His Mom (can't entirely blame him, she's one of my favorites as well)
      </li>
      <li>Music (especially Sea Shanties)</li>
      <li>Saying <em>'Ho, Ho, Ho"</em> anytime he sees:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Anything wearing a long cap and has a beard</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Santa</li>
          <li>Garden Gnomes</li>
          <li>One of the Seven Dwarves</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Generic Christmas Decorations</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Red/Green</li>
          <li>Excessive Snow Flakes</li>
          <li>Tinsel</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reindeer</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Throwing his food on the floor during lunchtime</li>
      <li>Dad</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      (I may have skipped a few things just to get my name up there, but you get
      the point)

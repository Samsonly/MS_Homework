    <h1>Everything About Samson</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Stage Manager, and I have been working in the Twin Cities for the
      past 12 years. I have worked with many theatres, including Old Log, Six
      Points, Lyric Arts, and Walking Shadow. In addition to working as a Stage
      Manager, I have Directed, Designed, Performed, and even wrote almost a
      dozen produced plays. I am currently working on a program that will
      hopefully help Stage Managers migrate their work to a digital format. I am
      also a father to an amazing little boy named Orion, and my unbelievably
      supportive and wonderful wife and I are expecting our daughter, Theo, in
      June.
